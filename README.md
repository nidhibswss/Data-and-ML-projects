# Data anlaysis and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning and data analysis projects. 
Each project explores a different ML concept or algorithm, including classification, clustering, 
association rule mining, anomaly detection, and model evaluation.

##  Topics Included
- Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Decision Tree Classification
- Naïve Bayes Classification
- Neural Network Classification
- Clustering (e.g., K-Means)
- Association Rule Mining (Apriori)
- Anomaly Detection Techniques
- Model Overfitting and Performance Evaluation

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

##  Goal
To practice and build intuition for core machine learning methods through hands-on implementations.
